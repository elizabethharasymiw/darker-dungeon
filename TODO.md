# TODO list for version v4.x.x
- [ ] Add a mini-quest to find a key to open the exit door
- [X] Modify the map to be more complex, add a hallway and a extra room
- [ ] Add more description of the environment, like telling the player when they are next to a wall or in a corner

# Unplanned feature ideas
* Hot and Cold mini-game based on what the game wants to get next, the door location or the key's location for example
* Add other objects or interactions for the player to find if they ignore the main escape quest
* Remove the need for the player to press "enter" for each option and do the options in response to a keypress instead.
