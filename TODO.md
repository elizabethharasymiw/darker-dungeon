# TODO list for version v4.0.1
- [ ] Refactor code base to have all classes in separate files
- [ ] Refactor getShortestDistanceExit function to BFS solution instead of hard coding it.
- [ ] Rename Menu class to something about game state, then pull out Menu specific functionality into its own class again.
- [ ] Refactor all ArrayLists to Arrays where I do not need dynamic resizing

# Unplanned feature and TODO items
* Add other objects or interactions for the player to find if they ignore the main escape quest.
* Remove the need for the player to press "enter" for each option and do the options in response to a keypress instead.
* Add a mini-quest to find a second key to open the exit door.
* Change controls to either arrow keys or WASD.
